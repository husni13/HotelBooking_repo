Please open the demo folder to see the video which briefly shows how the app works.

I would also like to add that this is a very simple version of this app and if the app 
were to be developed completely it would require a lot of updates. This is all to show
that the functionality of the app is not an issue whatsoever.

The reason the app lacks certain updates or "flashy" stuff is that 
I choose to focus on React.js and other projects.

Thank you for making time to check out my repos !
